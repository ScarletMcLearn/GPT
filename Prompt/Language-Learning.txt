I will give you a sentence in English.
Please translate the sentence to Germany.
I want the words in the translated sentence have the corresponding word in English in brackets. 

For example:

Input: 
Hello, I am Ratul.

Output:
Hello (Hallo), I (Ich) am (bin) Ratul (Ratul).
Hallo, Ich bun Ratul.

I do not want the entire translated sentence at once.
I want the translation of  the individual words in brackets as shown above.
After the translation of the individual words, I want the entire translated sentence.
